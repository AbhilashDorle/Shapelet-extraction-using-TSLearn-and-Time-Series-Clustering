The program generates ".mat" files for time series data using the TSLearn library

The .mat files generated contain the actual values of Shapelets which can be further utilized for various purposes. 

Shapelets are discriminative subsequences that maximally define a class. 

TSLearn library implements the paper "Learning Time Series Shapelets, Grabocka et. al. , KDD'14"

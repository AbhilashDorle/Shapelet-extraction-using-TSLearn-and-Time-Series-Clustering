The program generates ".mat" files for time series data using two methods:
1. Using the TSLearn library
2. Using Time series clustering

The .mat files generated contain the actual values of Shapelets which can be further utilized for various purposes. 

Shapelets are discriminative subsequences that maximally define a class. 

TSLearn library implements the paper "Learning Time Series Shapelets, Grabocka et. al. , KDD'14" 
Time Series Clustering is implemented according to the method presented in "Clustering time series using unsupervised-shapelets, IEEE-2012"
